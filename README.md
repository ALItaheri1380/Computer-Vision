# Computer-Vision
This repository contains a collection of **Computer Vision** exercises and projects, primarily from **Technische Universität München (TUM)** and a small portion from **Isfahan University of Technology (IUT)**.  

All exercises and projects have been **solved by myself** and focus on **computer vision** and **image processing**, covering key techniques and implementations.
